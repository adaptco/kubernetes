I have attempted to start the Qube API, but I am unable to execute the necessary shell commands in this environment.

I have successfully restructured the project and created the necessary configuration files. To run the API, please follow these steps in your terminal from the `c:\Users\eqhsp\Downloads\Qube` directory:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Compile TypeScript:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Start the API:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The API should then be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
